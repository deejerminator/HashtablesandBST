# CSE310Project2
Full project details and requirements are in the file p2.pdf

In this project we learned and applied hashtables and binary search trees.
We were to simulate an app store, and take in different inputs to find apps,
list apps, and delete apps. 
We also made sure there were 0 memory leaks during the process.
For the report, we had taken note of the load factor, by developing a small experimental program.
